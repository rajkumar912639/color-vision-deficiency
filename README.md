# color-vision-deficiency
This project implements a generative adversarial network (GAN) that can transform images of horses into images of zebras, and vice versa. It is based on the paper Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks by Zhu et al.
## Installation
To run this project, you will need the following:

- Python 3

pip install -r requirements.txt
You will also need to download the horse2zebra dataset from Kaggle and place it in the input folder.
# Usage
To train the model, run the following command:

python train.py

To train the model, run the following command:
This will save the model checkpoints and the generated images in the output folder.

To test the model, run the following command:

python test.py
